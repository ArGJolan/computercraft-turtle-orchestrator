# ComputerCraft Turtle Orchestrator

A web based ComputerCraft Turtle orchestrator.
Used for mining, but I'll possibly work on more advanced features soon.

## Motivations

I wanted to create a self replicating turtle that I need to setup once and it would go and mine / fork by itself with little to no maintenance.
I'm lazy and don't want to learn RedNet, so orchestrating them externally sounded like a good idea.
